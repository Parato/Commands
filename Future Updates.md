to do:

- a auto quest command (maybe adding in the daily command)

      - have to do: 
      
          - collect all quest possibilities
          
          - get the amount of the things you have to do
          
          - get the reward (if the reward is bad, should skip the quest)
          
          - if the quest is not possible to do on one day (because of cookies for example), ping Parato, do nothing or idk smth like that

- bad word filter

      - if the message commands are trying to be used (reverse, 1337speak, etc.), filter some words and either replace them with something else or just respond with
        nothing or a :pepeKnife: or smth
        
        
- ban protection

      - if the please verify you are human in max 10 min message shows, ping Parato and stop what you have been doing so far
      
      - or if advanced enough, program an ai that can solve captures in png files and then send the solution to the bot in dm's 
     
     
- interface for the .exe file

      - right now its just a command window and you can't do anything with it
      
      - Make a proper windows application out of it
      
      - should be able to:
      
          - select the server and channel you want to send messages is
          
          - Send messages which you can type in the app
          
          - Have buttons to activate commands like autohunt/autobattle/autoall/weather/etc.
          
          
- rework the whole code so its less messy

      - delete uneccessary code
      
      - compact code
      
      - delete unused aliases 
      
      - delete unused imports
      
      - fix taking from other classes
          
          
          
to fix:

- [DONE] sending owo vote x2 when secretdaily command

- rename "+secretdaily", "+secreth", "+secretb", "+secretall"
